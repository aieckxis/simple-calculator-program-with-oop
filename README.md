# Simple App Calculator - OOP Principles

This Python program is a **simple calculator application** that uses **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.** It allows users to perform **basic math operations** like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**. The MathOperations class handles user input, validates it, performs the requested operation, and displays the result. If the user tries to divide by zero, an error message is shown, and they can enter the second number again. The application continues until the user chooses to exit. It demonstrates the use of OOP to create a straightforward and functional calculator.

## Usage
Using Command Prompt: 

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Command Prompt".
2. Click on "Command Prompt" to open the command prompt window.
3. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing the script file. For example, if the script file is located in the "Documents" folder, type: cd Documents
4. Type the command python script_name.py to run the script. Replace "script_name.py" with the actual name of the script file.
5. Press Enter to run the script.
6. The script will run and follow the prompts to input the operation and two numbers.
7. If user attempt to divide by zero, an error message will be shown, and user will be asked to enter the second number again.
8. User can then choose to try again or exit.

Alternatively, you can also run the script using the Python IDLE environment:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Python".
2. Click on "Python" to open the Python IDLE environment.
3. Click on "File" at the top of the window and select "Open".
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script file and select it.
5. Click on "Run" at the top of the window and select "Run Module" or press the F5 key.
6. The script will run and follow the prompts to input the operation and two numbers.
7. If user attempt to divide by zero, an error message will be shown, and user will be asked to enter the second number again.
8. User can then choose to try again or exit.
